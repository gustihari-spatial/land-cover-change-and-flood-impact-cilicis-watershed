# Land Cover Change and Its Impact on Flooding
## Cilicis Watershed (1990–2024)

## 📌 Project Objective
This project analyzes land cover change over a 34-year period and
assesses its impact on flood occurrence in the Cilicis Watershed
to support watershed management and flood mitigation planning.

## 🌍 Study Area
Cilicis Watershed (Wilayah Sungai Cilicis), Jakarta, Indonesia

## 🛠 Tools & Software
- ArcGIS Pro

## 📊 Methodology
1. Land cover classification for 1990, 2009, 2020, and 2024
2. Land cover change detection
3. Overlay analysis with flood-prone areas
4. Spatial interpretation of flood impact

## 🗺 Key Outputs
*(Final maps will be displayed here)*

## 📈 Key Findings
- Significant increase in built-up areas between 1990 and 2024 as much as 138%.
- Reduction in vegetated land correlates with increased flood-prone zones
- Flood events are more frequent in areas with rapid land cover change

## 🔗 Data Sources
- Land Cover Data: Obtained from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry of Indonesia (KLHK) for the years 1990, 2009, 2020, and 2024. 
The datasets were generalized and validated using:
• Landsat satellite imagery (2024, 2020, 2009)
• Google Earth imagery (1990)
- Flood Event Data: Acquired from the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) 
and filtered to include flood events occurring between 2020 and 2024, based on the dataset updated as of 25 February 2025. 
The data were spatially analyzed using point-based flood location coordinates.
